The purpose of this project is to re-organize some graphic files in the King County Archives. The files are intended to be re-organized in appropriate directories and file-names in Multi-Page .tif files, where each multi-page .tif file contains only one deed ore record.

In order to use, change the file path to the TIF file you want to use in the CombineTiff.java file where it says new File("/home/abraham/data/DEL002/D192/392/373.tif"). Also, change the file path to your output file where it says transform.writeOutputImage("/home/abraham/Development/outputImage.png"
Only change the file path between the quotes.
